      <h2>KICK START YOUR CAREER WITH </h2>
      <p>Hi all,

I won't be taking classes atleast for the next week as I have contracted Covid

Your DSA sessions will be replaced by either Aptitude sessions or some other section for the coming week

We will resume the DSA sessions once the situation improves a bit, most likely at the beginning of May

Further details about the schedule will be communicated to you by the Cantilever Labs team

Do not stop ur coding practice
Keep practicing on codeforces.com, geeksforgeeks, give CF contests and revise it all

Find questions on the topics we have covered, sort based on difficulty and keep solving problems on CF

I hope to see that all of you have solved 20 - 40 problems on CF and have made significant improvement in the implementation part :)

Until we meet again..</p>
